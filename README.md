# IMDB-Data
As seem below. In it's current state you copy and paste your imdb ID and after a while you get back certain statistics about your account.

The progress "bar" that exists as of now. Shows the information you could need. Updates when a request is sent back.

Took 30minutes of waiting for responses. Hoping to get this down to 10 minutes. 31k ratings. ("Does not seem to be a way to speed it up")

Trying to figure out how to use matplotlib. But look at this cool thing. Shows you your ratings by month.
Will change this to a bar graph since it makes more sense.
