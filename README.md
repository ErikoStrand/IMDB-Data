# IMDB-Data
As seem below. In it's current state you copy and paste your imdb ID and after a while you get back certain statistics about your account.
Only warning I can give you is that it takes about 3.5 seconds per 100 ratings and that is not including your tv-shows.

Trying to figure out how to use matplotlib. But look at this cool thing. Shows you your ratings by month.
Will change this to a bar graph since it makes more sense.
