As seem below. In it's current state you copy and paste your imdb ID and after a while you get back certain statistics about your account.


Only warning I can give you is that it takes about 3.5 seconds per 100 ratings and that is not including your tv-shows.

Getting some hang of how to use matplotlib. Now shows your genres too. Switching the color scheme up a bit.
